class StartGenerator(object):
    """Class for generating random starting candidates.

    Its basic task consists of randomly placing atoms or
    molecules within a predescribed box, while respecting
    certain minimal interatomic distances.

    Depending on the problem at hand, certain box vectors
    may not be known or chosen beforehand, and hence also
    need to be generated at random. Common cases include
    bulk crystals, films and chains, with respectively
    3, 2 and 1 unknown cell vectors.

    Parameters:

    slab: Atoms object
        Specifies the cell vectors and periodic boundary conditions
        to be applied to the randomly generated structures.
        Any included atoms (e.g. representing an underlying slab)
        are copied to these new structures.
        Variable cell vectors (see number_of_variable_cell_vectors)
        will be ignored because these will be generated at random.

    blocks: list
        List of building units for the structure. Each item can be:

        * an integer: representing a single atom by its atomic number,
        * a string: for a single atom (a chemical symbol) or a
          molecule (name recognized by ase.build.molecule),
        * an Atoms object,
        * an (A, B) tuple or list where A is any of the above
          and B is the number of A units to include.

        A few examples:

        >>> blocks = ['Ti'] * 4 + ['O'] * 8
        >>> blocks = [('Ti', 4), ('O', 8)]
        >>> blocks = [('CO2', 3)]  # 3 CO2 molecules
        >>> co = Atoms('CO', positions=[[0, 0, 0], [1.4, 0, 0]])
        >>> blocks = [(co, 3)]

        Each individual block (single atom or molecule) in the
        randomly generated candidates is given a unique integer
        tag. These can be used to preserve the molecular identity
        of these subunits.

    blmin: dict or float
        Dictionary with minimal interatomic distances.
        If a number is provided instead, the dictionary will
        be generated with this ratio of covalent bond radii.
        Note: when preserving molecular identity (see use_tags),
        the blmin dict will (naturally) only be applied
        to intermolecular distances (not the intramolecular
        ones).

    number_of_variable_cell_vectors: int (default 0)
        The number of variable cell vectors (0, 1, 2 or 3).
        To keep things simple, it is the 'first' vectors which
        will be treated as variable, i.e. the 'a' vector in the
        univariate case, the 'a' and 'b' vectors in the bivariate
        case, etc.

    box_to_place_in: [list, list of lists] (default None)
        The box in which the atoms can be placed.
        The default (None) means the box is equal to the
        entire unit cell of the 'slab' object.
        In many cases, however, smaller boxes are desired
        (e.g. for adsorbates on a slab surface or for isolated
        clusters). Then, box_to_place_in can be set as
        [p0, [v1, v2, v3]] with positions being generated as
        p0 + r1 * v1 + r2 * v2 + r3 + v3.
        In case of one or more variable cell vectors,
        the corresponding items in p0/v1/v2/v3 will be ignored.

    box_volume: int or float or None (default)
        Initial guess for the box volume in cubic Angstrom
        (used in generating the variable cell vectors).
        Typical values in the solid state are 8-12 A^3 per atom.
        If there are no variable cell vectors, the default None
        is required (box volume equal to the box_to_place_in
        volume).

    splits: dict or None
        Splitting scheme for increasing the translational symmetry
        in the random candidates, based on:

        * `Lyakhov, Oganov, Valle, Comp. Phys. Comm. 181 (2010) 1623-32`__

        __ http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2010.06.007

        This should be a dict specifying the relative probabilities
        for each split, written as tuples. For example,

        >>> splits = {(2,): 3, (1,): 1}

        This means that, for each structure, either a splitting
        factor of 2 is applied to one randomly chosen axis,
        or a splitting factor of 1 is applied (i.e., no splitting).
        The probability ratio of the two scenararios will be 3:1,
        i.e. 75% chance for the former and 25% chance for the latter
        splitting scheme. Only the directions in which the 'slab'
        object is periodic are eligible for splitting.

        To e.g. always apply splitting factors of 2 and 3 along two
        randomly chosen axes:

        >>> splits = {(2, 3): 1}

        By default, no splitting is applied (splits = None = {(1,): 1}).

    cellbounds: ase.ga.utilities.CellBounds instance
        Describing limits on the cell shape, see
        :class:`~ase.ga.utilities.CellBounds`.
        Note that it only make sense to impose conditions
        regarding cell vectors which have been marked as
        variable (see number_of_variable_cell_vectors).

    test_dist_to_slab: bool (default True)
        Whether to make sure that the distances between
        the atoms and the slab satisfy the blmin.

    test_too_far: bool (default True)
        Whether to also make sure that there are no isolated
        atoms or molecules with nearest-neighbour bond lengths
        larger than 2x the value in the blmin dict.

    rng: Random number generator
        By default numpy.random.
