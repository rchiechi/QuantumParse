Low-Level API Reference
=======================


This documentation contains the auto-generated API information for the
HDF5 for Python "low-level" interface, a collection of Cython modules
which form the interface to the HDF5 C library.  It's hosted separately from
our main documentation as it requires autodoc.

These docs are updated less frequently than the spiffy ReadTheDocs-hosted
main documentation; this means roughly once per minor (X.Y) release.

This may not be what you're looking for!

**The main docs for h5py are at** http://docs.h5py.org.  **These are
the docs specifically for the h5py low-level interface.**
